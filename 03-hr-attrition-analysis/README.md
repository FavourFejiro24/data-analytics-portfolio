# HR Attrition Analysis (Excel & Power BI)

This project analyzes employee attrition patterns using **Excel for metric development and exploratory analysis**, and **Power BI for data modeling and dashboard visualization**.

The goal of the analysis is to understand **why employees leave the organization**, identify high-risk groups, and provide **data-driven recommendations** to reduce attrition.

---

## Tools Used
- **Excel**
  - Pivot tables
  - Aggregations (average, count, percentages)
  - Metric development and validation
- **Power BI**
  - Data modeling
  - DAX measures
  - Interactive dashboard design

## Analysis & Metrics Developed (Excel)

Before visualization, key metrics were developed and validated in Excel, including:

- Attrition rate by department  
- Attrition rate by job role  
- Attrition rate by gender
- Average years at company
- Average salary hike (leavers vs stayers)
- Average job satisfaction (leavers vs stayers)  
- Average environment satisfaction (leavers vs stayers)  
- Attrition rate by salary hike percentage (grouped ranges)

This step ensured the business logic and calculations were correct before building visuals.

## Dashboard Focus Areas (Power BI)

- Overall attrition rate and employee counts  
- Departmental and role-based attrition patterns  
- Impact of satisfaction and salary increases on attrition  
- Identification of high-risk employee segments  

---

## Key Insights
- Certain departments and job roles experience disproportionately higher attrition.
- Employees with lower job and environment satisfaction are more likely to leave.
- Lower salary hike ranges are associated with higher attrition risk.

## Business Value
The insights from this analysis can help HR and management:
- Target retention strategies for high-risk roles
- Improve satisfaction drivers within key departments
- Adjust compensation strategies to reduce avoidable attrition
